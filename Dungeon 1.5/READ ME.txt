Dungeon 1.5 is a massively updated version of my "Dungeon" game jam. 
I am currently working to overhaul the game completely, as this version of the game was still entirely based on years old code from the first Dungeon game. 
I am not releasing the source code for this, but may in the future.  
 
The file here consists of the demo for my test level for some of the games mechanics.  
 
WASD to move
Space to rotate current occupied tile (Only for Blue and Green Tilegroups)  
Click + Drag to move Tilegroups (Only for green Tilegroups and only while unoccupied)  

Collect keys to unlock doors.
